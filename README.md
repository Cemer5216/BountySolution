## Version : 20230531-1.0

In version 1.0, some basic function need to be implemented.

1. **User system :** Realize user registration, login, personal information editing and other functions, as well as user permission control and other related functions.
2. **Release bounty :** It's used to publish a bounty task, including the task title, description, task requirements, bounty amount, limit on the number of participants, etc.
3. **Display bounty :** Displays a list of all current bounty tasks, and supports searching and filtering by different types and sorting methods.
4. **Participate in the bounty :** Users can view the detailed information of the bounty task on the bounty details page and choose to participate in the bounty. Participants need to submit their own works or answers for the publisher to review. After the review is passed, the corresponding bounty amount can be obtained.
5. **Bounty management :** The bounty publisher can manage the bounty tasks released by himself, including task status management, participant review, reward distribution, etc.
6. **Payment and settlement :** The system needs to integrate the payment function, allowing the publisher to pay when the reward is released, and to settle and issue rewards after the task is completed. Of course, it also supports paying the reward in advance, in which case an exclusive token will be generated, which will only be delivered when the publisher confirms that the task is completed or the submitted task meets the task settlement conditions.
7. **Virtual currency and integral system :** Users can recharge and withdraw virtual currency, and can view balances and transaction records. Virtual currency can also be used as part of the integral system. Users can obtain a certain amount of virtual currency according to their performance and activity.
